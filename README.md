# Web_scraper
This is a web scraper developed by Samuel Ikoli that extracts the Title, Type, Description and Image from a website. On the front-end is html, embedded Javascript and bootstrap's CSS; on the back-end is Express running on Node.JS. The scraping functionality is derived from using axios to make HTTP requests, then using cheerio to Parse the incoming HTML response and extracting the required metadata.
